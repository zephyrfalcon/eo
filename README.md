# Eo

This is Eo, a stack-based/functional/etc hybrid language.

## Current status

Eo is currently not under active development.

## Requirements

* ooc
* pcre library

Currently only tested on Mac OS X (using Homebrew).

To compile, just enter `rock` or `rock -v` while in the `eo` toplevel directory. (This should produce a file `eo-main`, among other things.)

To run the Eo test suite, enter `eor --test` in the toplevel directory.
(Running the `test` script will produce a few errors.)

**Update 2017-09-03:** I worked on this in 2015. Currently it still compiles (using
macOS Sierra 10.12.6, XCode ___, Homebrew 1.3.1), but I get a bunch of
warnings.
